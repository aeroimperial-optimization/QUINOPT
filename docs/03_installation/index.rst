Install QUINOPT
===============

QUINOPT is easily installed by running the installer ``installQUINOPT.m`` in MATLAB. Below is a detailed installation guide.

-----------------------
Step 1: Install YALMIP
-----------------------

QUINOPT is an add-on for YALMIP, the optimization modeling software by J. LÃ¶fberg. If you already have YALMIP installed, you cak skip this step. Otherwise, `download YALMIP's latest version <https://yalmip.github.io/download/>`_ and install it by adding the following folders to MATLAB's path:

.. code::

   YALMIP-master
   YALMIP-master/extras
   YALMIP-master/solvers
   YALMIP-master/modules
   YALMIP-master/modules/parametric
   YALMIP-master/modules/moment
   YALMIP-master/modules/global
   YALMIP-master/modules/sos
   YALMIP-master/operators

You can test your YALMIP installation by running

.. code-block:: matlabsession

   >> yalmiptest

at the MATLAB command prompt. More details on how to install or update YALMIP be found `on YALMIP's website <https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/installation/>`_.


.. note::

   The folder names above are the default when YALMIP is downloaded from GitHub. Should you wish to use a different folder name, simply replace ``<YALMIP-master>`` with the appropriate path.


------------------------------
Step 2: Install an SDP solver
------------------------------

To be able to use QUINOPT, you need to install a semidefinite programming (SDP) solver compatible with YALMIP. A complete list of YALMIP-compatible SDP solvers can be found `here <https://yalmip.github.io/allsolvers/>`_.

.. warning::

   QUINOPT has been tested with `SeDuMi <https://github.com/sqlp/sedumi>`_, `SDPT3 <http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html>`_, `SDPA <http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/>`_, and `Mosek <https://www.mosek.com/>`_ (free for users in academia). Other suitable YALMIP-compatible SDP solver should work, but use them at your own risk!


-----------------------
Step 3: Install QUINOPT
-----------------------

If you have successfully installed YALMIP and a compatible SDP solver, you are ready to install QUINOPT. First, `download QUINOPT's latest stable version`_
(for the "developer" version or previous versions, visit the `Download`_ page).

After unzipping the downloaded folder, navigate to it in MATLAB and simply run the installer:

.. code-block:: matlabsession

   >> installQUINOPT

The installer should add the required folders to the MATLAB path and run
some test problems to make sure everything is working. If you experience any installation problems, please `contact us`_ or file an issue issues via the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/aeroimperial-optimization/QUINOPT/issues>`_.
